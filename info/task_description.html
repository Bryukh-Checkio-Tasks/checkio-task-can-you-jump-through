    Given a matrix A NxN where (5<=N<=10), and [x1, y1], [x2, y2] pairs where
    (1<=x1,x2 and y1,y2<=N), x1, x2 are the row numbers of two points in the
    matrix while y1, y2 are column numbers. Matrix A consists of zero and
    non-zero numbers. You can pass from one point to another by moving
    horizontally and vertically through zeros, but you can't intersect any
    non-zeros. Be careful -- row and column started to count by 1.
    You should to determine -- is there a way from [x1,y1] to [x2, y2]?
