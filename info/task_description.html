<p>
    You are given matrix A, which is NxN where (5<=N<=10,) and the pairs [x1, y1], [x2, y2]  where
    (1<=x1,x2 and y1,y2<=N). x1 and x2 are the row numbers of two points in the
    matrix while y1, y2 are column numbers. Matrix A consists of both zero and
    non-zero numbers. You can move from one point to another by moving
    horizontally and vertically through zeros, but you can't intersect any
    non-zeros. Think of each zero like it is a hoop you may jump through.
    Be careful though, rows and columns start with 1.
    You should try to determine if there is a way to travel from [x1,y1] to [x2, y2].
