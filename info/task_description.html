    If you have solved <a href="TODO">"How to find friends"</a>,
    then you know how to check the existence of a path in graphs.
    Let's add something in that problem.
</p>

<p>
    You are given a matrix (2D array) and coordinates (row and column) of two cells with the same value.
    The matrix consist by various digits and you can move to neighbour cells horizontally and vertically,
    if values of cells from and to are equal.
    Your should determine if a path is exist between the two given cells.
</p>

<p>
    A matrix is represented as a tuple of tuples with digits.
    Coordinates are represented as a tuple with two numbers - row and column.
    The result should be any values which can be converted in a boolean.
    If a path exist, then True and False if not.

<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong>
    Three arguments. A matrix as a tuple of tuples with integers,
    first and second cell coordinates as tuples of two integers.
</p>

<p><strong>Output: </strong>The existence of a path between two given cells
    as a boolean or a value that can be converted to boolean.</p>

    <strong>How it is used: </strong>
    Sometimes we don't need the full pathfinding algorithms implementation and can use
    simplified realisation of these algorithms.
    It can be an useful skill to find a simple ways/

    <strong>Precondition:</strong><br>
    0 &lt; len(matrix) &le; 10<br>
    all(0 &lt; len(row) &le; 10 for row in matrix)<br>
